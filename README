This is my personal powershell profile that I clone between various Windows machines I work on

** Important: Copy "environment.example.ps1" to "example.ps1" and edit the paths inside before use **

It imports posh-git and posh-svn to give auto-complete etc for working copies & clones of those repos

It also asdded a few useful commands:
- gs -> "git status"
- n -> "notepad"
- sudo -> launch process as Administrator (in new window)
- hosts -> edit hosts file in notepad
- dev -> jump to "Development" directory where you checkout your projects
- dropbox -> jump to dropbox
- start-mongo -> Run MongoDb instance (needs to be in your dropbox)
